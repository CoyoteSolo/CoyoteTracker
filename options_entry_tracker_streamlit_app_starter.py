Here’s how to deploy your Options Entry Tracker to **Streamlit Cloud** so you can use it like an app on your Apple device:

---
**1. Prepare your app**
- Make sure all your code (including `requirements.txt`) is in a GitHub repo.
- `requirements.txt` should list your dependencies:
  ```
  streamlit
  yfinance
  pandas
  numpy
  matplotlib
  ta
  ```

**2. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**
1. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and sign in with GitHub.
2. Click **New app**, choose your repo, branch, and `main` Python file.
3. Deploy — Streamlit will build and host your app.
4. You’ll get a public URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`).

**3. Add to iOS Home Screen**
1. Open the app link in Safari on your iPhone/iPad.
2. Tap the **Share** icon at the bottom.
3. Select **Add to Home Screen**.
4. Name it (e.g., “Options Tracker”) and tap **Add**.

Your tracker now works like a native app — full screen, with an icon — without going through the App Store.

**Tip:** Any updates you push to your GitHub repo will automatically refresh on Streamlit Cloud after redeploy.

**Result:** Fast, zero-approval process, instantly usable on your Apple mobile device.
